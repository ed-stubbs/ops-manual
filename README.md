# Ops Manual
This is my attempt to condense the advice I've received and experience I've gained over the years into a single place. This is intended entirely for my personal use, but if you find it helpful then please share it.

# Meetings

## Agenda
All meetings should have an agenda. By default the meeting owner is responsible for writing the agenda, unless they have delegated to someone else.

## What is the purpose of a meeting?
All meetings must have a purpose. Each agenda item should be for one of three things:

1. Decision
2. Input
3. Awareness

### Decision
It must be clear to whom the decision belongs. Accountability matters. If too many people have responsibility for making a decision, it may never be made (ref. bystander effect), or any follow-up will not have a clear point of contact.

Be clear on the consequences of each decision. What action will be taken as a result? Will reversing this decision have a high cost?

### Input
Whose input is being sought, and why? 

Meetings primarily focussed on gathering input should be structured around that. No slides or presentation other than those necessary to share the context. 

Leave enough space for questions, especially if seeking input from someone unfamiliar with the current state.

### Awareness
If a meeting agenda comprises exclusively "awareness" items, consider whether it should be an email. Otherwise it risks being a waste of time for the presenter and the audience, or becoming an unstructured Q&A session.
