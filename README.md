# Meetings

## Agenda
All meetings should have an agenda. By default the meeting owner is responsible for writing the agenda, unless they have delegated to someone else.

## What is the purpose of a meeting?
All meetings must have a purpose. Each agenda item should be for one of three things:

1. Decision
2. Input
3. Awareness

### Decision
It must be clear to whom the decision belongs. Accountability matters. If too many people have responsibility for making a decision, it may never be made (ref. bystander effect), or any follow-up will not have a clear point of contact.

Be clear on the consequences of each decision. What action will be taken as a result? Will reversing this decision have a high cost?

### Input
Whose input is being sought, and why? 

Meetings primarily focussed on gathering input should be structured around that. No slides or presentation other than those necessary to share the context. 

Leave enough space for questions, especially if seeking input from someone unfamiliar with the current state.

### Awareness
If a meeting agenda comprises exclusively "awareness" items, consider whether it should be an email. Otherwise it risks being a waste of time for the presenter and the audience, or becoming an unstructured Q&A session.

# Planning

## People are bad at planning
History shows that people are very bad at estimating how long they will take to complete large, multi-step projects. This is known as the [planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy). In a study, when asked to provide 50th, 75th and 99th percentile estimates for how long they will take to complete an assignment, less than 50% of students completed their assignment by their own 99th-percentile estimates.

### Inside view
The "inside view" is planning based on what you know about the project at hand. This is highly susceptible to optimism bias.

Evidence shows that even after several similar projects, people tend not to learn lessons around planning and time estimation, continuing to take the optimistic view and assuming they have perfect knowledge of the future. They assume that the issues that arose in previous projects were unique and specific to those projects, and won't arise in future. While this may be the case with the specific issues, the overall incidence of issues from "unknown unknowns" is unlikely to change much from project to project -- especially within the same organisation, field, or class of projects.

### Outside view
The "outside view" is planning based on past experience from similar projects. This has been shown to give much more accurate predictions than the inside view.

It is less susceptible to optimism bias. People have to justify explicitly why their project will take less time than previous ones, instead of implicitly assuming an absence of unforeseen problems.
